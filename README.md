<h1>Vulnerability Management</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This repository is a comprehensive guide to vulnerability scanning and remediation. Utilizing Nessus Essentials, Iâ€™ve meticulously outlined the step-by-step process, focusing on conducting credentialed scans of local virtual machines hosted on VMWare Workstation. Join me as I demonstrate how to identify vulnerabilities, implement effective remediation solutions, and validate their effectiveness through subsequent rescans. This hands-on project provides invaluable insights into the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle, offering practical learning experiences for cybersecurity enthusiasts

After i got my ip address, i did my first scan. using the ip address as my target. Nessus detected that the remote service understands the Bonjour (also known as ZeroConf or mDNS) protocol, which could potentially expose sensitive information about the host, including its operating system type and version, hostname, and the list of services it is running: <br/>

<h2>Remediation</h2>
<p align="center">
To mitigate this vulnerability, I filtered incoming traffic to UDP port 5353. By implementing this solution, I restricted access to the mDNS service, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and information disclosure from the host.

This simple configuration adjustment enhances the security posture of the network by limiting exposure to potential threats associated with the Bonjour protocol:<br/>
